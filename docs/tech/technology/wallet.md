# Getting started with the ThreeFold Wallet

Here we discuss how to create and use the ThreeFold wallet from the command line.

For this we use the ThreeFold Chain client, `tfchainc`.

> We highly recommend against installing a wallet on the same host running a ThreeFold Chain Explorer


## Get the ThreeFold Chain binaries

Creating and using a ThreeFold wallet from the command line is done through the **ThreeFold Chain client**, `tfchainc`. 

See [Getting the ThreeFold Chain Binaries](/technology/get_binaries.md) for instructions on how to get the ThreeFold Chain client.


## Connecting to a ThreeFold Chain node

In order to use the ThreeFold Chain client (`tfchainc`) you need access to an active ThreeFold Chain node.

You can optionally create your own ThreeFold Chain node, as documented in [Creating a ThreeFold Chain Node](/technology/create_node.md).

Test the connection as follows, specifying the address and port of the node you want to connect to with the `--addr` (`-a`) option:
```bash
./tfchainc --addr <ip>:<port>
```

So in case you have a ThreeFold Chain node on the same host as the client, using the default port:
```bash
./tfchainc --addr localhost:23110
```

In this case you can even omit the `-addr` option, since `tfchainc` by default will try connect to a local daemon on port 23110:
```bash
./tfchainc
```

In what follows we will assume you have a local node listening on the default port.

## Initialize your ThreeFold wallet

Initializing a new ThreeFold wallet is done by using the ThreeFold Chain client (`tfchainc`) as follows:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet init
```

This will ask you to enter and confirm a **passphrase**, and as a result you will get a **seed**, that will allow you to recover your wallet at any point, from any other computer. 

> Make sure to save your seed in a safe place.

## Unlock your ThreeFold wallet

When you check the status of your initialized wallet for the first time you will see that it is `Locked`:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet

Wallet status:
Unencrypted, Locked
Unlock the wallet to view balance
```

To unlock execute:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet unlock
```

Trying to unlock your waller before initialing will result in a error stating that your wallet has not been encrypted yet.

Once you entered your passphrase your wallet is ready to use:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet

Wallet status:
Encrypted, Unlocked
Confirmed Balance:   0 TFT
Unconfirmed Delta:   + 0 TFT
BlockStakes:         0 BS
```

## Manage your ThreeFold wallet addresses

A new wallet is initialized with 10 addresses, here's how to list them:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet addresses

01034498a5b73b0aeb79e4fe4e932f83fd4bff522032af3237d7addd0ab5b360242a7af0c0b83c

```

In order to create a new address:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet address

Created new address: 0150f4c2eb561d844da74dc9c4a673be4092bb3e8975d47dead6fc7954067c62a128e8d047c606
```


## Receive your first ThreeFold tokens

Send one of your addresses to a token holder and ask him/her to transfer tokens to your Wallet.

Once done you can check your wallet as follows:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet
```

While the transaction is being processed you will see the number of tokens that are being transferred next to **Unconfirmed Delta**:
```bash
Wallet status:
Encrypted, Unlocked
Confirmed Balance:   0 TFT
Unconfirmed Delta:   + 100000 TFT
BlockStakes:         0 BS
```

By executing the ThreeFold Chain client without any additional option (`./tfchainc`) you can check the `height` of the ThreeFold chain:
```bash 
Synced: Yes
Block:  1f57f7f95e3f5ed16fd1dd0b3b8068b33d8766f5e647bcf2fe251837fa246a48
Height: 35
Target: [0 0 46 154 118 247 78 176 79 95 18 157 50 4 71 45 235 179 185 47 73 58 53 110 23 100 136 183 34 255 127 215]
```

Note that in this case the `height` is still `35`. Once the transaction is confirmed the `height` will be higher, at least `36`:
```bash 
Synced: Yes
Block:  72cc5ebbfa62126287e71c7516a0d5e3ead91eaa73314b89dbe24880b9bd26eb
Height: 36
Target: [0 0 46 154 118 247 78 176 79 95 18 157 50 4 71 45 235 179 185 47 73 58 53 110 23 100 136 183 34 255 127 215]
```

Checking your wallet once the transaction is confirmed by executing `./tfchainc wallet` will show your updated **Confirmed Balance**:
```bash
Wallet status:
Encrypted, Unlocked
Confirmed Balance:   100000 TFT
Unconfirmed Delta:   + 0 TFT
BlockStakes:         0 BS
```

## Send your first ThreeFold tokens

First get an address from a friend, for instance: `01b22509f331e6c4ef268b82405bf9f69b957a7160e580424b75329ee83a6833c160fc4ffabef2`.

In order to transfer 5 token execute:
```bash
./tfchainc wallet send coins 5 01b22509f331e6c4ef268b82405bf9f69b957a7160e580424b75329ee83a6833c160fc4ffabef2
```

You will get a confirmation:
```bash
Sent 5 TFT to 01b22509f331e6c4ef268b82405bf9f69b957a7160e580424b75329ee83a6833c160fc4ffabef2
```

When checking your wallet (`./tfchainc wallet`) while the transaction is being processed you'll see again an updated value next to **Unconfirmed Delta**:
```bash
Wallet status:
Encrypted, Unlocked
Confirmed Balance:   100000 TFT
Unconfirmed Delta:   - 5.1 TFT
BlockStakes:         0 BS
```

> Note the transaction fee of 0.1 TFT.


Checking the ThreeFold chain (`./tfchainc`) while the transaction is being processed shows:
```bash
Height: 39
Target: [0 0 46 154 118 247 78 176 79 95 18 157 50 4 71 45 235 179 185 47 73 58 53 110 23 100 136 183 34 255 127 215]
```

Once the transaction is confirmed you will see that the `height` will be `40` or higher. 

## Check transaction in the Explorer

The ThreeFold Chain Explorer for the test network is available on https://explorer.testnet.threefoldtoken.com and for the standard net on https://explorer.threefoldtoken.com

See [Install the ThreeFold Chain Explorer](/technology/tfchain_explorer.md) for instructions on how to setup your own ThreeFold Chain Explorer.

Specify your receiving address `015c1172cb8f9a970c9bb6bcbd7a51e31b0d54e997db1709f751f107afb51e7601282c1c87b200` in the **Search by hash** field, which will show the **coin output** of your first transaction:

Clicking the **Parent transaction** link shows the full transaction:

Clicking the second output, brings you back to your updated (`Has Been Spent` changed to `Yes`) **coin output** of the transaction:
