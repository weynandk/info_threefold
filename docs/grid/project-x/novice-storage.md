Within the 3bot Admin console, a chatflow has been created to reserve S3 storage capacity. 
This storage can be dispersed over different nodes.

Through this chatflow, S3 storage is reserved and configured simply by collection of a number of parameters : 
- IPv4 vs. IPv6
- Password to be used for the 0-db storage
- Disk type : SSD or HDD
- Mode : user or sequential
- Minio login key
- Secret to match the previous key
- Amount of CPUs needed
- Memory size needed (in GB)
- Number of data drives to be used for spreading the data
- Number of parity drives
- Network definition (existing or new)
- If new network : IP range to be used (self-selected or generated)
- Network name (in case network is meant to be reused)
- IP address to access the storage

This information is sufficient to create the workload on the network.

The network might yet be set up, using Wireguard.
For ubuntu machines, you get command line instruction:

On MacOS, the Wireguard configuration can be set up through the Wireguard application : 
- Download the configuration into a file

- load this into Wireguard tunnel

Finally, the location of the workload is shown :
