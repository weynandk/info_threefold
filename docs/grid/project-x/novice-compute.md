## Deployment of a Kubernetes cluster through the chatflow

Within the 3bot Admin console, a chatflow has been created to reserve capacity to run Kubernetes cluster on.

Through this chatflow, the kubernetes cluster is reserved and configured simply by collection of a number of parameters : 
- IPv4 vs. IPv6
- Number of worker nodes
- public ssh key (allowing to access the container using ssh)
- cluster secret
- network definition (choice between reuse of a netork that has been set up earlier or new one)
- ip addresses to access all workers

This information is sufficient to create the cluster.

If you choose to define a new network, this needs to be activated using Wireguard (see explanation on network).

Once this is done you can ssh into the virtual machine from your account that you used the ssh key from.
