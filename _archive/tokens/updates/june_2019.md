# Token Update 
June 1st, 2019

## Intro

Internet capacity (data, computation and storage) is the new gold of our digital economy. There is a +trillion dollar challenge currently facing the ICT (Information Communication and Technology) world on how to meet this exponentially growing internet capacity demand based on growing requirements from Edge Computing, AI and IOT. 

ThreeFold has provided a scalable answer to this global challenge, through a global network of decentralized internet capacity that is autonomously managed. This network is supported by independent farmers (capacity providers) and enables developers to easily deploy services on a "self-driving" internet grid. This enables current cloud services as well as blockchain protocols to scale beyond the limitations (complexity, security and scalability) of current ICT solutions.

ThreeFold Token is a decentralized digital currency and the exclusive medium of exchange to buy and sell, autonomous and decentralized internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. Generated only when hardware is added by farmers on the network.

 
## Facts
  
**Blockchain Protocol**: [Proof of Blockstake](https://wiki.tokens.grid.tf/#/technology/proof_of_blockstake)

**Total Token Capitalization**: $ 36,844,327 

**Max Supply**: 100,000,000,000 TFTs (100 Billion TFTs)

**Potential Revenue of the Grid (Per Circulating TFTs over 5 years)**: $ 0.48

**Cores in the Grid**: 14.6K 

**Storage**: 79 PB
 
## SWOT

### Strengths: 

TFT is a valuable internet utility token that’s backed by decentralized internet capacity.
The TF Grid is autonomously driven and this enables cloud vendors, blockchain protocols and developers to easily launch decentralized capacity to support their projects without complexity and scalability limitations. 
Lower market capitalization compared with current blockchain market so more upside for early token supporters.  

### Weakness: 

Our documentation needs work (in progress), it's complex and our story is not simple enough (working on it), we also have not been marketing mainly due to technology preparation and we have a small team (new hires in progress).  

### Opportunity: 

Can go up big time because of our current low market cap, most people don't know about us yet, we have formulated some very strong partnerships (ecosystem) and have some exciting use cases to drive adoption. 

### Threat: 

Plan for active commercial grid and marketing efforts needs to be followed.

## Plan for Liquidity

Our plan for liquidity relies on driving the usage of the ThreeFold Token for real and demanded applications and use cases. For a year now our farmers have been deploying hardware (10x more hardware compared to the sum of all blockchain companies in the same space as of Dec. 2019), forging strategic partnerships and now we are ready to show what we have done.  Please take a look at our growing ecosystem community. 

Long term liquidity will gradually come online with more applications hosted on the “TF Grid”, new financial market bridges, liquidity support, and a strong marketing campaign to drive awareness and growth of our community and token usage. Please check out the latest updates on the latest developments that will help boost liquidity and market awareness:
 
 
## New Updates
### Extended Marketing Team:
To support our ramp up efforts we have expanded our decentralized marketing and communication team, who are busy cleaning up and updating our messaging, starting an active marketing campaign and will be engaging the community regularly.
