## What can 3Bot do?

3Bot has been designed to be as efficient as possible. The current memory footprint is less than 200MB yet still it is a wiki system, database, blockchain, web server, indexing & search machine, e-commerce system, wallet, decentralized exchange, and more. It can manage millions of objects and is the center of your digital life or organization.

3Bot performs specific functions to help regulate and maintain the functions of the global information system. It empowers the Circular Decentralized Internet.

By nature, a 3Bot is stateless (has no data storage of its own). 3Bots have the capabilities to secure and use the necessary raw storage and compute resources on the TF Grid. 3Bots own digital currencies (ThreeFold Tokens or TFT), that can be exchanged for capacity and compute resources on the TF Grid. Data cannot be lost because of the above described dispersed storage algorithm.

A 3Bot can store a petabyte of information as long as enough TFTs are available so the required resource can be reserved on the individual TF Nodes. 3Bot is the only entity which has the required information and keys to retrieve your distributed data.
