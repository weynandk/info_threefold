# Testnet progress

To familiarize groups of people with the TF Tech technology there are several testnets available. These setups allow for private and public service deployments.

## Testnet V0.1
The first available Testnet setup is one where we bring down all of the security fences that exist in the Zero-OS operating system. In this setup, people can directly start, stop and destroy containers on a physical (or virtual) Zero-OS machine.

Still available but has to be done online.  All grid capacity is currently up and running with full security.  If interested in doing low level local testing please contact us.

## Testnet 1.0 (discontinued)
Testnet 1.0 was based on zero-OS 1.0 and allowed developers to create and own their own 3bot from which they could orchestrate workloads on all active capacity boxes on the TF Grid.  Test 1.0 had testnet token and allowed for capacity reservation to be made on various machines and containers deployed.  Due to a radical design change in the capacity reservation mechanism testnet 1.0 has been taken down and towards the end of 2019 testnet v2.0 will be launched

## Testnet V2.0
Testnet 2.0 is planned for mid december.  Documents and tutorials will be made available as soon as possible.
