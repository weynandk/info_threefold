### 2.6.  Payment of TFTs to the Purchaser
The TF Farmer receives TFTs in 3 ways.
        1. As a result of connecting the Farming Pool to the TF Grid (“Farming”): XXXX TFTs  (total amount) are created (“Farmed”) as result              of connecting the Farming Pool to the internet during the entire term of this Agreement. This is all arranged by the TF Chain as              long as the Farming Pool stays connected to the internet.
        2. the remnant of the € xxxxxx, being $ xxxxxx, tokens will be supplied a rateof $ x.xx per token which adds up to xxxxxxxx tokens
        3. As a result of TF Users reserving capacity on the Farming Pool (“Cultivation”). 

Provided that (1) payment of the Purchase Amount is received on Company’s account on or before April 1st, 2018, and (2) the Farming Pool remains connected to the TF Grid without interruption for 60 months as from when the Farming Pool is first connected to the TF Grid, a total amount of xxxx TFTs  will be Farmed, i.e. as a result of the monthly connection of the Farming Pool to the TF Grid for 60 subsequent months, these TFTs will be fully allocated through the TF Chain to the Purchaser. 

Standstill token sales is 6 months for all tokens.

Each 30 days the TF Chain will directly send the Farmed TFTs (1/60th of total amount) to the TF Wallet of the Purchaser provided always that the registered uptime for the Managed Farming Pool was achieved over the previous 30 days - this during maximum 60 periods of 30 days.

The TF Chain runs the Zero-Robot software as used to provision workloads on the Farming Pool of the Purchaser. The TF Wallet connected to the Zero-Robot receives the funds from TF Users reserving capacity in the Farming Pool.

The TFTs earned as a result of IT Capacity sales (cultivating) from the TF Farming Pool as described in this Agreement, will be allocated through the blockchain (TF Chain)  as follows:
            * 60% of such TFTs will be allocated to the Purchaser (acting both as a TF Farmer and as a TF Farming Cooperative);
            * 10% of such TFTs will be allocated to the TF Foundation for supporting the promotion of  the TF Grid;
            * 10% of such TFTs will be allocated to the Company as an additional remuneration for all services provided to the Purchaser and
            * 20% of such TFTs will be allocated to the GiG as license fee.

## 3. Term and Termination
The Agreement is entered into for a fixed term starting on the Effective Date and ending five (5) years as from the Delivery Date of the Farming Pool. 

The Company cannot terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration date.

The Purchaser can terminate this Agreement at any time prior to its expiration date with a minimum 3 months notice. 

Standstill token sales is 6 months for all tokens.

Upon receipt of a termination notice from the Purchaser, the Farming pool will be unregistered by the Company from the TF Chain, which means no TF User can order new capacity from the Farming Pool, the TF Chain will inform all impacted TF Users to migrate their workloads away to an alternative TF Farming Pool of choice.

When terminated the Purchaser can use the hardware from the Farming Pool as described in this contract at its own discretion. Upon the Purchaser’s request the Company may even re-register the hardware as a new managed or unmanaged farming pool but the price of the TFT will be determined at that time and will be used by the TF Chain as a new start for farming (in other words all historical price increase benefits will be lost).
