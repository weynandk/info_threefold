## The Measurement Period Definition for TF Farming and TF Grid Capacity Usage

Farming is always calculated for 60 months (5 years).


#### To make it easy to calculate

* the amount of TFT per month
* the SLA per month
* the price of CU and SU per month

there needs to be a generic month which we will call period.

This generic period is 30.44167 days which is 730.6 hours.


#### How is the period calculated?

The 30.44167 day period is calculated as the average ‘month length’ if we look at the farming duration of 5 years. 
A farm has a minimum of 1 leap year and a maximum of 2 leap years over a period of 5 years. For the period with 1 leap year (4 years with 365 days, 1 year with 366 days) the average month in hours is 730.4 for the period with 2 leap years (3 years with 365 days, 2 years with 366 days) the average month in hours is 730.8. So the average (if we say its 50:50) is 730.6 hours a month which is 30.44167 days. 


#### This means

Monthly TFTs will always be paid after a period of 30.44167 days.

#### Note: Periodic TFTs will be paid within 48 hours after the period closed.

The farmer SLA (Uptime) is measured in 30.44167 intervals.

Monthly capacity prices are for a period of 30.44167 days aka 730.6 hours.
