## IT capacity provisioning flow 

Reservation of capacity happens according a standard process : 
- Farmer sets a price
- User searches capacity
- User requests reservation
- Payment process
- Automated provisioning process of the workload towards the nodes

If all OK : 
- Confirmation of the provisioning and complete payment to the farmer
- Further deployment instruction to the user

In case of an error in the provision flow : 
- Reporting of the error
- Refund to the user
