# Setting up a Network
## How to set up a network using the chatflows?

The network set-up is integrated in each of the chatflows (on ubuntu, flist, S3, kubernetes, ...). 

- If you haven't set up your network yet, select a new network :

This network then needs to be defined using Wireguard. 
A different setup is needed on Ubuntu machines and on Macbook : 
- For Ubuntu machines, install wireguard using wg-quick
