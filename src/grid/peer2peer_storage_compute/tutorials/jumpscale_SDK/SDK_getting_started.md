### How to get started with the SDK

#### Prerequisites
The prerequisites of getting started with the SDK are:
- you got yourself the 3bot.connect app in the apple or google play store `# Insert link to installation page`
- you have installed the jumpscale SDK on your laptop.  (installation instructions here: [linux](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold/blob/development/docs/wikieditors/installation_linux.md) or [macos](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold/blob/development/docs/wikieditors/installation_macos.md))

#### How to work with the SDK

There are numerous ways to use the SDK and use the TF Grid.  We will mention two ways which are the two ones we prefer.  Obviously you might find other methods work better for you.

##### Option 1:  User the graphical administration panel

After installing on a local system there should be a 3bot SDK start with a SDK admin panel.  To connect to it you should connect to the IP address on which the docker container is operating.  
    1. For a local system install there is a port forwardwarding to the `localhost` allowing you to do this `[http://localhost:7000'](http://localhost:7000).  
    2. If you have installed in a virtual machine running ubuntu on your localhost you should be able to connect to the IP address of the VM.  Same format 'http://<< IP-address-of-the-VM >>:7000

The following screen should welcome you:

##### Option 2: Login the container and use the CLI interface
You can also login into the container and use the availabe CLI interface to manage code and execute code.
