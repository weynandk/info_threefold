## Questions needed to prepare for upcoming call

- Share the vision and initial use cases?
Most of what the vision is and the largest use case of the technology is presented [here](https://threefold.io/).  The [Threefold technology](https://www.threefold.tech/) is fueling this decentralisd, private and democratic internet, build by many for you.
For use cases of the ThreeFold Grid there are many.  As we all know the currenct leaders in the cloud and social space have a business model around collecting information from users and selling that information for commercial advertisment use cases.  Any service that runs on the internet today running on Linux servers can be run on the ThreeFold grid.

- What key problem being solved here?
The problem that the internet is monopolised and run by a handful of large enterprises that are in the business of understanding people behavior and using that understanding to infuence people.  A this point in time there is no governance and as proven by the Feacebook hearings in the US not even governments can extend any control on what the monopolies are doing.  For reference have a look at [the great hack](https://www.thegreathack.com/)

- Who owns the datacenters?
The ThreeFold Grid is build by people for people.  The capacity making up the grid can exists in datacenters, but do not have to be there. ThreeFold invites everyone to build a part of this new capacity grid which can be done anywhere, in schools, in offices and in the homes.

- When you say autonomous - what technology is powering the orchestration of the data centers?
The technology powering the autonomous internet is [jumpscaleX_core)(https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core).  This technology is opensource and the result of more than a decade of research and development to get to a framework that enables digtial (autonomous) workers to execute grid maintenance and operations tasks and goinf forward start, run, stop and destroy any linux based IT workload on the grid.

- How are these data centers currently being funded?
Independent people (farmers) fund the equipment that is needed to build this grid. They also pay for the operational costs to keep the capacity online, power and cooling costs and the network connection.  These farmers get a digital return for doing this that represents (in 5 years) 6 to 10 times return of investment (ROI)

- Assuming they are tier-3 and fully functional
The grid capacity can be in datacenters, do do not need to be.
