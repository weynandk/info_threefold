# Where can one find the technical requirements for ThreeFold farming hardware?

## Question

There is a lot of interest in small-scale farming, but the hardware requirements do not seem to be written down, particularly for single nodes that are financially possible for many people. It is very important that capacity becomes widely available in many locations, so we need to understand the constraints for the hardware before promoting the ThreeFold system. This information is also needed if we are to approach manufacturers to produce hardware for future farmers.

## Answer

This is work in progress. In general please consider that the following high level requirements are considered to be the minimal requirements.  Older and smaller might work but there might not be enough token return in using that hardware to cover for the electricity, network and "cooling" cost.

- intel based CPU with at least 2 physical cores.
- 8 GB of ram
- 128 GB of SSD storage
- 1 TB of HDD storage

This combination of components provides you with a setup that will run Zero-OS and after the grid has inspected the hardware will provide a token return of approximately <<insert token return number>>
