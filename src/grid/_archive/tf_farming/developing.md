## Introduction
Developing on the TreeFold grid can be done on multiple levels. The ThreeFold software creates three distinct and functionally separated layers.

As a developer you have a choice to work with the capacity layer only.  Working with the capacity layers gives developers full control in a similar way that full control is available in other public capacity solutions (clouds).  This layer comes with orchestration tools that are know in the market (eg. Kubernetes) and will run containers (100% backwards docker compatible).

Documentation and other information materials for this is to be released before the end of 2020 for developers to start developing on this grid / migrate existing workloads from known capacity providers onto this new capacity platform.

The autonomous layer provides a very different interface to architect and operate IT workloads on the TF Grid.  The autonomous aspect of it comes from bot technology.  The technology is open source and can be found here: https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core

This technology is used to create independent digital workers that perform very specific tasks in and for this grid.  This grid is meant to run everywhere without having any requirements for people to maintain it. The actual operations for the grid are carried out by digital workers, the bots.  ThreeFold Tech has build specific bots with specific knowledge how to do tasks to maintain and operate the grid but also allows for other people to create new knowledge and capabilities.  Providing new knowledge and insights is a different way to create and operate IT workloads on the TF grid.
