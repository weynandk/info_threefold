## Token Generation Rules

![](./img/farmer.png)

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:

- Farmed Tokens: as a result of connecting IT hardware to the internet, ThreeFold tokens are generated
- Cultivated Tokens: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users

This document describes how Farming Tokens are issued in more detail.

<a id='goals'></a>

## Goal

- TFTs are backed by [internet capacity](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/it_capacity.md)
- Internet capacity needs to be good enough
- Reliable hardware (good enough hard disks and SSDs, because data is stored on them)
 	- Uptime needs to be good enough
- Internet capacity needs to be everywhere (promote distribution)
- Avoid abuse, people trying to cheat the system, e.g. dirty farming, or people who just add capacity to get tokens with no intent to sell capacity


## Farmer types

Three types of farmers:	
- Cooperative Farmers: purchase a range of services from a ThreeFold Cooperative up to and including, ThreeFold Certified Hardware, installation, location, power and connectivity
- Individual Farmers: create certified ThreeFold Capacity using ThreeFold Certified Hardware but complete their own installation, and providing their own location, power and connectivity
- DIY Farmers: who create uncertified ThreeFold Capacity using their own choice of hardware

### Certified Capacity

- [Definition of ThreeFold Capacity](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_capacity.md)
- Uptime
    - Farmer defines an uptime guarantee appropriate for their production environment (connectivity, housing, power)
    - Uptime history of the Farmer's Farming Pool is listed on the TF Chain
- Hardware components: TF Certified Hardware
    - TF Certified Hardware is supplied by ThreeFold Certified Cooperatives. ThreeFold Certified Cooperatives are accredited by the ThreeFold foundation because they have proven they are compliant with the Certified Coop rules <<insert link>>
- Farmed and Cultivated Tokens
    - Amount of Farmed Tokens see rules of [Creation of TFTs](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/blob/master/docs/tf_farming/threefold_principles.md)
    - For Certified Hardware the difficulty level is currently set at 8. The difficulty level is managed by the Guardians of the ThreeFold Foundation.
    - Because Certified Hardware is being used, Farmed Tokens are released by the [TF Chain](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_chain.md) immediately.  This means the Farmer has access to the tokens and can do with them what they want.
- Cultivated Tokens are available immediately after capacity has been utilized.

### Uncertified Capacity

- [Definition of ThreeFold Capacity](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_capacity.md)
- Uptime requirements
    - Farmer defines an uptime guarantee appropriate for their production environment (connectivity, housing, power)
    - Uptime history of the Farmer's Farming Pool is listed on the TF Chain
- Hardware requirements
    - Any type of hardware can be used. This hardware can be new or refurbished.
- Farming of tokens
    - For amount of tokens generated, see rules of [Creation of TFTs](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/blob/master/docs/tf_farming/threefold_principles.md)
    - For Uncertified Hardware the difficulty level is currently set at 8, currently the same as for Certified Hardware. The difficulty level is managed by the Guardians of the ThreeFold Foundation.
    - Because Uncertified Hardware is being used, Farmed Tokens are released by the [TF Chain](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_chain.md) from the moment the [Farming Pool](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_farming_pool.md) of the Farmer has more than 30% utilization. Please note: Farmed Tokens are accumulated from the moment of connection, the 30% rule is to ensure that Farmers list usable capacity.
- Cultivated Tokens are available immediately after capacity has been utilized.

## Existing Cooperatives active today!

**You can become a TF Farmer today by using existing TF Cooperatives.**

- See [inital cooperative directory](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/tree/master/docs/cooperatives)

You can be part of these cooperatives, buy your hardware and be your own farmer. Please contact them for specific details. Each cooperative has their own commercial offerings to allow you to become a farmer starting today.

Do you want to create your own cooperative, please contact the ThreeFold Foundation, we can help you how to get started.

<a id='become-farmer'></a>

## How to become a TF Farmer (without cooperative)

Do you want to become your own TF Farmer, please become part of our early adopter program and we get you initiated in everything you need to know to be most successful as a TF Farmer. We will start mid April with online sessions. Before June 1 any TF Farmer hardware will be connected to our testnet (is our TF Grid made for testing purposes), this way your hardware capacity can be validated.

Your TF Hardware pool will be registered in the official TF Chain starting June 1.

The ThreeFold Foundation will also be organizing technical sessions for people who want to learn how to use the capacity of the TF Grid in most optimal way. This will happen face to face as well as online.

## Farmer registration rules during June-July 2018

During the startup period of the TF Grid we start with predefined register token pricing (till end July 2018).
These rules are registered in the TF Chain.

Important: TF token pricing in public market can be different.

- Token generation rules see this [link](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/blob/master/docs/tf_farming/threefold_principles.md#creation-of-tfts)
- TFT token price used for registration = US $0.1
- Also see [Capacity measurement](#capacity-measurements) here below
- During this startup period the sales prices of SU/CU are fixed:

| Farming Pool Type | Compute Unit CU | Storage Unit SU |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Unmanaged Refurb | USD 10 | USD 10 |
| Unmanaged New | USD 12 | USD 12 |
| Managed | USD 20 | USD 12 |

## Capacity Measurements

Zero-OS measures [**Resource Units**](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/blob/master/docs/concepts/resource_units.md) and registers this in the TF Chain.

| Unit type | Description | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| core unit     | 1 logical core (hyper-threaded core) | CRU |
| mem unit      | 1 GB mem	| MRU |
| hd unit       | 1 GB raw storage capacity | HRU |
| ssd unit      | 1 GB	raw storage capacity | SRU |

[Cloud Unit](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_grid/blob/master/docs/concepts/cloud_units.md) capacity is calculated as follows:

| Cloud unit type | Calculation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 SU | #HRU / 1090 | nr of HRU (GB HD capacity) / 1093 |
| 1 SU | #SRU / 135 | nr of SRU (SSD HD capacity) / 92 |
| 1 CU | min(#CRU*2,#MRU/4*(1-5%)) |minimum of twice the nr of cores, mem /4 with 5% overhead|

The 1.09 and 135 are calculated as follows (for details see following [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrG_bvrPl1I4q6FLScLwZDfe5HJ_DWOfY9RjZ8fZI4/edit#gid=75337142

- 1090 = (70% Archive Capacity + 30% NAS Capacity) / 0.75
    -   0.75 is overhead for redundancy and some unused storage capacity
-   92 = 40% SAN SSD capacity which is redundant + 10% DB SSD capacity which is redundant + 50% STD ssd capacity / 0.6
    -   0.6 is estimate of unused SSD capacity, what will not be used in future


These conversion parameters can be redefined together with difficulty level by 60% majority vote of ThreeFold Ambassadors.

These rules are running as smart apps inside our TF Chain.

A sheet exists to help you simulate your capacity and token creation, please contact the TF Foundation for help.
Link of this spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TsrG_bvrPl1I4q6FLScLwZDfe5HJ_DWOfY9RjZ8fZI4/edit#gid=374757817)


<a id='imposed-retrospectively'></a>

## Imposed retrospectively = time of registration counts

At registration of the capacity the following parameters are registered:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| tokens | tokens rewarded per 30 days is result of calculation and most important param |
| token price | token price at the moment of registration |
| sales price cloud units | sales price of CU & SU for chosen Farming Pool Type at registration |
| resource conversion units | conversion units from resource to cloud units (1090, 135, ...) |
| uptime = SLA |  only relevant for managed Resource Pool, min required uptime (for other capacity = 99.5%) |
| date | registration date |
| min percent utilization | minimum utilization degree before farming tokens are rewarded |
| period duration | fixed on 30 days |
| farming periods | nr of periods the farming tokens are rewarded |
| farming pool size | in CU/SU and CRU/MRU/HRU/SRU |

Some of above parameters are fixed & pre-defined during startup period (until end of July 2018), see above.

Once registered the amount of tokens given per month and accumulated if the minimum required utilization has not been achieved yet are fixed by this digital contract registered in the TF Chain.
Even if the TF Ambassadors decide to change some of the parameters this will not have an impact on already registered TF farming pools.

If a TF farming pool gets unregistered e.g. because of 3 months breach of uptime then this contract becomes void.
