# ThreeFold Farming


## Introduction
We probably donâ€™t need to tell you that the invention of Blockchain technology changed the world dramatically. The ThreeFold application of Blockchain technology to compute and storage capacity is one of the most exciting initiatives we have seen to date.


## The problem
There are some major challenges with the current foundation of the internet and how it has moved from being a medium to independently share information amongst internet users to a multi-billion dollar industry governed by a few (American) companies.

## The solution
The ThreeFold Foundation has the key to change the internet for good, and you might want to play a big role in this. And so can you! By becoming a farmer you are taking part in that process. You are contributing to a significant increase in Net Neutrality which has come under serious threat in recent years. You are helping to build a more sustainable Internet for generations to come by giving the internet back to the people.

The ThreeFold Foundation has created end-to-end technology that creates a very stable (crypto) currency with neutral, private and distributed capacity generating hardware as a financial backing mechanism.

## The ecosystem
The ThreeFold Ecosystem is a token economy where tokens (crypto currency) are being generated (and therefore financially backed) by internet capacity generating equipment, owned by anyone and housed anywhere, building and creating internet capacity owned and operated by all of us, creating wealth and business opportunities for anyone in the world while building a rock-solid foundation for a currency that is less volatile than any other (crypto) currency.

What is more, all Farmers who sign up now to purchase internet capacity servers or create capacity pools are amongst the first doing so and therefore they enjoy a higher return on investment than people that will join at a later stage.
