## ThreeFold Grid Concepts

![](grid.png)

ThreeFold Foundation is a nonprofit foundation which promotes a new global network of IT capacity. For more details see their website:  https://ThreeFoldtoken.com/. 

ThreeFold Foundation has created a new digital token called ThreeFold Token (“TFT”). These TFTs are managed by the ThreeFold Blockchain (the “TF Chain”). The TF Chain can issue a maximum of 100 Billion TFTs. 

ThreeFold Farmers (“[TF Farmers](https://docs.grid.tf/threefold/info/src/branch/master/legal/definitions.md)”) are independent third parties who invest in IT hardware consisting of storage and compute servers (the “Farming Pools”) which are connected to the ThreeFold Network (“TF Grid”) and are registered on the TF Chain. Each Farming Pool TF Nodes runs the TF Operating System and TF Blockchain Software which allows anyone in the world to use this IT capacity to host their IT workloads (storage apps, archive capacity, web applications, artificial intelligence, iOT, docker containers, etc). 

TFTs are exclusively issued (created) by the TF Chain for each active Farming Pool which gets and remains connected to the TF Grid. Such issuance of TFTs is called “Farming”, i.e. just like certain cryptocurrencies get ”mined”. In that sense a ThreeFold Farmer is the equivalent of a miner on the Bitcoin network. In the case of ThreeFold, Farming means the connection of a server and storage hardware (IT Capacity) to the TF Grid and producing useful IT capacity which can be used on a global scale. All connected capacity gets registered on the TF Chain. End of March the TF Foundation estimates that less than 0.9% of the total amount of TFTs will have been Farmed. 

To use this IT Capacity, through the TF Grid, people need to own TFTs as they are the only possible mechanism to purchase or sell this IT capacity as delivered by the Farming Pools through the TF Grid. As such, TFTs represent a true utility. 

### Creation of TFT's

The TF Chain issues new TFTs for each Farming Pool each 30 days using the following calculation:

> Monthly (30 days) Issued Tokens (TFTs) per Farming Pool =  
> average monthly sales price of connected Farming Pool capacity(*)
> / difficulty level
>
> (*) at connection time expressed in tokens 

Difficulty level for 2018 is 8 for Unmanaged Capacity and 6 for Managed Capacity. If required, the difficulty level can be adjusted with a 80% majority vote of the ThreeFold Ambassadors by means of the TF Chain. 

Because of this mechanism, TFTs are initially undervalued by a factor of 6 to 8. If 100% of the underlying IT capacity is bought at connection time, then 6 to 8 times more TFTs would be required as have been issued. This mechanism allows the TFTs to grow in value while being backed by revenue potential of the TF Grid.

### Capacity

For [Managed Capacity](https://docs.grid.tf/threefold/info/src/branch/master/legal/definitions.md) the TF Farmers needs to specify the uptime they want to achieve when they register their IT capacity in the TF Chain. The TF Foundation expects most Managed Farming Pools to achieve an uptime of more than 99.5%. The TF Chain will only issue TFTs if the Managed IT capacity was connected to the internet and was usable during the last month at least up to the specified uptime guarantee; this will automatically stop after 60 months. The TF Chain software will execute these checks on a random basis; these are peer checks done by independent Farming Pools. For Unmanaged Capacity a minimum uptime of 95% is required, this cannot be defined by the TF Farmer but is a standard uptime requirement.

Thanks to the unique ThreeFold software the Farming Pools use a lot less power compared to traditional data centers. Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally - similar to the way electricity and other utilities are purchased today. This allows any digital service/application provider anywhere in the world to host their applications near to the users leading to greater performance and overall efficiency.

### Exchange

In addition, the ThreeFold Foundation has created a fully neutral and distributed exchange, which runs on top of the TF Chain (the “TF Exchange”). The TF Exchange is neutral and not linked to any organization or company. TFTs can be exchanged for Bitcoin (“BTC”), Bitcoin Cash (“BCH”) and Litecoin (LTC) on the TF Distributed Exchange. BTC, BCH and LTC can be bought on any public exchange. In addition to using digital currencies a TF Farmer can sell or buy TFTs (for any accepted currency). As such any TFT owner can exchange their TFTs for existing fiat and digital currencies BTC, BCH or LTC at any point in time. There are no transaction fees on this exchange.

More details regarding the above can be found on the ThreeFold website and on following link for the used [definitions](https://docs.grid.tf/threefold/info/src/branch/master/legal/definitions.md).


### ThreeFold’s objectives are three-fold:

**Utility** - The TFT is designed to have specific commercial utility as the designated currency for buying and selling IT capacity on the TF Grid. 

**Green** - The ThreeFold Chain Operating System (OS) runs on a decentralized and distributed network of dedicated hyper-efficient Zero-Node (Node) infrastructure, which enables extreme scalability delivered at an extremely low carbon footprint.

**Neutral** - ThreeFold Foundation aims to build a neutral and digitally responsible world by connecting humanity to a neutral and green internet. ThreeFolds Foundation does not have any shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any other corporation. ThreeFold Foundation is only a promotion organization. All technology used by ThreeFold is open source. All users and ThreeFold Nodes are registered on a blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.  ​
