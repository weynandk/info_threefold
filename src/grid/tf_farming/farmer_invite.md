Hi Eng. Ibrahim,     
  
As per our discussion, we have prepared an intro email with relevant information on how to join the ThreeFold Grid and start your own global farming (capacity hosting) cooperative in your requested regions.     
  
As an introduction, ThreeFold has released a technology roadmap that will enable the world to scale new type of distributed IT infrastructure rapidly and cost-effectively using a software-defined technology; essentially creating a decentralized and distributed compute and storage pool owned by many, for all to use.  This grid of capacity presents a neutral alternative to Amazon Web Services. Very important is that this grid is owned by many and not just one large centralised application.     
  
ThreeFold technology enables individuals, companies, and countries to trade IT capacity through ThreeFold's global blockchain directory and enjoy a return on investment that is between 10-15x over 5 years and enabling the reach of the internet capacity to economically stimulate growth within regions capacity is provisioned.

**ThreeFold ROI**    
  
There are three ways to engage with the Threefold Grid (TF Grid) and gain tokens.      
  
1. Buy Threefold Tokens
2. Become a Farmer.  A Farmer is someone or an organisation that wants to invest capital to own equipment and mine Threefold Tokens.
3. Become  a cooperative.  A cooperative is a company start performs commercial, financial and operational services for Farmers.  
  
The first method, buying tokens is by far the simplest method to  to become a farmer is the most simple way to engage with the Threefold technology.  It can be as easy as giving money to a cooperative to purchase and own mining equipment.
