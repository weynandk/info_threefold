# What is a Farmer?
The ThreeFold Grid is formed by ThreeFold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the ThreeFold Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint [ThreeFold Tokens](token_what.md) for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmer’s capacity on the ThreeFold Grid gets reserved by a user he gets ThreeFold Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of ThreeFold Farmers
There are two types of ThreeFold Farmers
- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with ThreeFold Tech for support.
- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.
