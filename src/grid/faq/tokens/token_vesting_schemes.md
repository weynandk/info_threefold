# How long does the farmer have to hold the subsidy ThreeFold token?

ThreeFold recognizes two categories of farmers:
- Farmers that purchase certified hardware from certified vendors
- Farmer that have decided to go 100% DIY

Both are absolutely fine but have a different farming token vesting scheme.  

For the Farmers that purchased certified hardware at known vendors they will not have a vesting period for their tokens at all.  their tokens are liquid form the moment they get them.

**Needs to be updated**
DIY Farmers have a rule applied to their farmed tokens of becoming  liquid only when the TF Chain recognizes the hardware to be used for 30% by actual real life Use cases. The reasoning behind this rule is that we want to avoid abuse by farmers of creating capacity based on old, refurbished or new hardware which will never run any real life use case and will just be there to farm  farming tokens (which in essence would make the ThreeFold capacity similar to bitcoin mining rigs.
