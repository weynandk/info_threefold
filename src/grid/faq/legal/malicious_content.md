## Question

What is ThreeFold doing to ensure that the platform cannot be used to promote dangerous, hateful, offensive content? Side note: YouTube has a whole group of people who spend their entire days reviewing content to try to ensure its platform is not used to promote hateful, despicable content. ThreeFold‘s motives may be pure, but the bad guys may think it is a great “under the radar” platform to help them evangelize their point-of-view. Is it better to have a completely hands-off neutral system and accept the fact that there may be some bad players out there using it as a cost of the neutrality?

## Answer

All of the capacity that exists and will grow is owned by Farmers, not ThreeFold. Therefore ThreeFold is not involved in any of the operational processes of the ThreeFold grid.  It cannot and will not control the content on the grid, it will not control and intervene with the applications on the grid.
