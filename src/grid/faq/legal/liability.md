# Liability and insurance

This is an overview of some of the questions that farmers have faced when they wanted to insure their farming equipment in commercial datacenters.  Questions will differ for different insurance companies but this FAQ intends to reflect the general answers for such questionaires.  This will be constantly updated. 

## Is the farmer legally liable for information stored on their nodes which is illicit/illegal or in contribution to illegal actions?

The farmers own the hardware and rents out capacity to others. This is a similar model as to what web hosting and managed services have been doing for decades. Per region and country there is specific legislation that a farmer needs to comply with. In general there is legislation which makes the consumer of capacity responsible for the data on the rented capacity, taking away the liability for that from the farmer.

## Will we be aware of who is signing up to use the facility and is there a right of veto?

You will see who has reserved aka bought your capacity but only the user id. Not the full name and contact details of the individual or company. There will be no veto as your capacity is on the grid controlled by blockchain technology. Everybody who has tokens can by your capacity. Insurers will want to see some control to avoid illegal activities.

## Approximately how many customers do you have? I appreciate that for the moment it is 0 but in order to give the insurers an idea of what we anticipate. Do you think that we will have few longterm customers in the future or many, changing often?

That's a really tough one to answer. It depends on the use case, workload, and and and…. . You can have one large customer who buys all your capacity or you can have as many customers as you have compute and storage units. The truth lays in the middle and only time will tell.

## Contract with client – do we exclude liability for consequential loss or financial damage greater than the value of the contract?

I would only stand in for the uptime you guarantee for your farm aka when can the capacity be reached/used per month.

## Is the delivery of our contracts time critical?

If you have capacity available on the grid for sale/usage people can reserve and use it according to the monthly SLA  of for example 99% availability.

## Could failure of our product result in loss of life or injury or damage to physical property? (I presume no)

Would say no as you only provide capacity people build solutions/services with.

## You noted that the worst case scenario if the product fails is immediate and significant financial loss – they have asked us to explain.

You are not selling a data protection service to a customer - you sell capacity on top of which a serve provider can build a data protection service which he sells to a customer. Not so green analogy: A cosmetic company can not make the crude oil supplier liable for a perfume which causes skin irritation with one of their customers.
