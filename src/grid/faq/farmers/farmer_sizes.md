## What types of Farming exists?

The Foundation recognises different type of farmers based on the type of TF Nodes that they operate. Eventually there will be 3 types of capacity which will lead to three type of farmers.

### Farming types

#### Do It Yourself Farming (DIY)
The farmers operate any type of hardware that runs the Zero-OS.  It can be new or refurbushed hardware, it can be in large or small quantities.  The DIY farmer has complete freedom what they bring to the grid.

#### Certified Farming
These farmers has chosen to bring certified hardware to the grid.  Certified hardware is hardware that has been certified by the ThreeFold foundation as hardware that is completely locked down and secure.  Currently there is only one type of certified hardware and that is hardware build by HP Enterprise.  This hardware has been certified to be configured in the factory (Express services) to specific farmer details and then locked down such that there can be no further changed made by anyone to the boot methodology and hardware specification.

#### Managed Farming
Managed farming does not exists yet.  This category might come into existence going forward.


### Farmed capacity
All these types of farmers will make the same utility available to the TF Grid.  This utility comes in three types:
- Compute Units (Logical cores and memory)
- Storage Units (HD and / or SSD capacity)
- Network Units (where to connect to the internet)

The TF Foundation will suggest prices for each certification levels in line with location e.g. home behind fiber, a commercial datacenter with multiple internet connections, telco POP, school/university/...with large bandwidth pipe, â€¦ The goal is to come up with the right ratio between price & achieved level of service. This will of course not happen over 1 day we will have to learn.

Some workloads will work everywhere e.g. the 3bots by themselves and we will have a lot of them. It makes a lot of sense to run a 3bot with micro-farmers, gives you lots of neutrality and there should be a price advantage.

Often there are different business models. E.g. a 60 Petabyte of archive in a serious swiss datacenter with super high-speed internet lines will position & price the capacity differently compared to the SOHO farmer with 1 node and 4 disks only.
