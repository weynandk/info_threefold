# Is there a default pricing for ThreeFold Grid capacity?

## Question

Farmers that have no idea or do not want to get involved in setting pricing for their capacity, how do they charge?

## Answer

There is baseline pricing for farmers. Capacity pricing is set in fiat and therefore no adjustment is needed when token pricing fluctuates.
