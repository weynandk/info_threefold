# How does ThreeFold calculate the ROI in their TFT simulation?

It is very simple, lets; define the components of a Return of Investement:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;ROI=\frac{R-C}{I}" title="\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}" />

* R = Revenue: equals all the Farming and Cultivation tokens that you get as a farmer accumulated over the 60 months period.
* C = Operational cost: equals all the cost incurred over the 60 month period, not including the initial investment.
* I = Investment: is all the costs you make at the beginning as one time payments: hardware, shipment, installation, initial system setup.

As ROI is calculated in a fiat currency and therefore all earned tokens need to be exchanged for fiat currency (or at least have a value expressed in fiat currency).  The ROI calculation is than as follows:


 Note: Operational cost are covered by selling TFTs (Tokens)
