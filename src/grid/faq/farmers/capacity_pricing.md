# How do farmers set capacity pricing?

## Question

The information we have seems to indicate that individual farmers set the price of their own capacity. Do they set a price in terms of tokens, or in terms of fiat currency? Either way, how do fluctuations impact the business of the farmers?

If the token price relative to fiat currency fluctuates rapidly, how do the small-scale farmers in particular regulate the cost of their capacity? It seems to me that it would be very useful if there were a baseline price for farming capacity that is somehow automatically adjusted to follow a constant price relative to fiat currency in order to allow farmers to have a “hands-off” management of their own capacity. Then it might be useful to allow farmers to set the price of their capacity in terms of a multiplicative factor times this baseline price.


## Answer

Farmer set their own pricing in **fiat** currency. Capacity reservations are paid for in token so a higher value of the token will provide them with less tokens than when there is a lower token value. Farmers have the freedom to change tokens to fiat when they believe they need to get fiat for business reasons or might sit on tokens to let them appreciate.
