# Is there a conflict between the ThreeFold Grid pricing and pricing set by individual farmers?

## Question

If individual farmers do set the price of tokens, will pricing of service by farmers be available for all to see? If I find that tokens are cheaper in Eastern Europe compared to California where I live, I may choose to buy capacity from the Eastern Europe cooperative.

## Answer

As discussed earlier/elsewhere:

The mechanism here is as follows:
 - Token value is determined by demand and supply on token markets by token holders selling their tokens and token buyers.
 - ThreeFold Grid capacity **pricing is set by Farmers** in **fiat** currency and made public by the TreeFold directory.

 Pricing of tokens will differ between exchanges and people selling token in other ways. Capacity pricing will differ in fiat as well. Purchasing tokens in remote exchanges or markets is fine and does not upset the distributed character of the grid at all. See it similar to buying Dollars or Euros therefore following the same rules and processes as fiat currencies having different pricing in different markets.
