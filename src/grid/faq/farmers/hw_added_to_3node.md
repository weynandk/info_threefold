## What happens when hardware components are added to a existing 3Node?

When additional hardware components like CPU, memory, SSD or HDD are added to a existing 3Node the additional components create additional CU and SU which leads to a higher TFT amount per month for this 3Node. This additional amount of TFT is paid until the end of the 60th month of the original 3Node being online. The additional TFT for the newly added components are calculated at the same TFT price and formula as the original 3Node to which these components have been added to.
