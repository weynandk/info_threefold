# Do larger nodes perform different functions than SoHo nodes?

## Question

Do the small “household” nodes perform a different function from the larger configurations?

## Answer

In short: No - SoHo nodes run Zero-OS and represent a (lot) smaller number of cloud units than the larger configurations. They will have a smaller number of applications running on it due to limited resources, but they might be part of a super resilient storage solution.

As an example of how SoHo nodes can be used to build a large virtual datacenter consider a telecommunications operator that has in a large number of cities fibre to the home. What if they consider putting a SoHo machine into each and every home that purchased their internet connectivity. Many commercial models can be deployed for this, the farmed tokens can be given as a discount to the telcos customer, the telco customer could be given an amount of storage capacity free of charge etc etc.  The telco would then have a distributed pool of capacity on which services can be build and run.

## How can I be assured that the computation on contributed CPUs ran correctly?

The ThreeFold grid nodes provide the raw materials to create computational capabilities.  However this are **only** raw resources.  These resources can be put to work to run containerized software solution or more traditional applications running in virtual machines.  On the technology side the ThreeFold grid is a very efficient way of creating raw compute an storage capacity that needs to be "stitched" together to make applications run on it.  It is the application in the end that needs to guarantee cooperation between different ThreeFold grid capacity pools.

To be absolutely clear the ThreeFold grid is not a traditional [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) solution.  The grid is meant to be an internet compute and storage capacity generator owned by many for all. This grid provides capacity as raw material for solutions to be build on it using this raw capacity.  It could run distributed computing software for which it wuld present the raw resources but is is not a traditional distributed computing system, usually with a single purpose to run large problem analysis software.  The ThreeFold Grid is a general compute the storage resource generator.
