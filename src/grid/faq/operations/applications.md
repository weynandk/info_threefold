# Do you have industry information regarding software developers creating applications on the ThreeFold Grid?

ThreeFold sees the ThreeFold Grid as a platform that presents primitives to developers that can and will create applications and services for it. ThreeFold will start launching marketing and promotion campaign towards the end of 2019 for the mass-scale marketing efforts to invite as many developers as possible.

You have to have an different mind towards to this platform. It has a very different approach towards building a community of developers, service providers and end users. Think of the launch of the iPhone with IOS and its Software Development Kit. At launch there were less than 50 applications available of which the most important ones were, a call application, a web browser, a message application and a music player (with some basic utilities around that like calculators and notes applications). Today there are literally millions of applications in existence, build by the community for the community. We envision a similar uptake of ThreeFold as a new platform to run distributed applications and the demand for applications and functionality will draw in developers and service and service providers.
