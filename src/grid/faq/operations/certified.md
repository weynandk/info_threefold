## Certified Hardware

### Why is certified hardware needed?

There are a number of good reasons that we want to work with so called "certified" hardware. These are:

 - To keep ‘dirty’ - high energy consumption - hardware off the grid.
 - To avoid hardware from farmers who only want to farm tokens and are not really interested selling their capacity.
 - To make sure the hardware runs Zero OS and all hardware resources (CPU, MEM, HDD, SSD) are displayed properly as capacity on the TF Grid.
 - To enable non IT savy farmers to become farmers.
 - To avoid lengthy support conversations which hinder the scalability of the grid (also known as) the TF Foundation

### Certification process.

The certification process is simple and efficient.  Here are the necessary steps:

 1. Connect hardware to the TF Grid
 2. Send the following information:
     - Zero OS working with specific hardware
     - Hardware resources as displayed on the directory
     - BOM (bill of material) which shows the on board resources (CPU, MEM, HDD, SSD)
 3. ThreeFold checks and compares above screenshots and info: if above info is valid and BOM matches resources as displayed on the directory the hardware is TF certified
 4. The specific hardware will be listed as certified on the TF Grid WIKI under the farmer section
 5. Info on how to get the hardware on the TF Grid - like necessary BIOS changes - will be posted in the same WIKI section

The early deployment phase of the ThreeFold grid has lead to a (growing but small) number of platforms that have been tested and certified.  Here's an overview:
