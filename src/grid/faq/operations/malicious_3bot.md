##  How can it be prevented that 3bots are given malicious code and deploy criminal activities on ThreeFold Grid?

Very interesting question.  As shown in the figure a 3bot receives its knowledge (abilities) from IT experts.  These IT experts will be for a very large part developers or system integrators that have good intentions and want to build or launch new services.  But, there will be people that will abuse the 3bot technology to launch malicious and or fraudulent applications.  What can be done about that?

The system in itself allows for anyone to build and create services on top of the TF Grid and by the decentralized nature the ThreeFold foundation or TF Tech will not govern, this would be 100% against the decentralized nature of this project.

The answer is not found in central governance, the answer is decentralized governance.  The technology is designed to have a human-based consensus mechanism and boasts strong technical features for this. Let's first dive into the non-technical part of the answer to the question. Decentralized governance follows the rules of everyday life. In real life, we all conduct checks and balances for everything we do and everyone we engage with.  Some examples:
- Does this shop-front looks like one of a legitimate business?
- Is the car salesman someone I can trust? Let me ask my friend that bought a car from him half a year ago.
- Is there some chat on the Internet about this e-commerce site? Do they really ship an order or take the money and run?
- Does this e-commerce site have the blessing of the consumer's protection association?

We do checks and balances in real life which gives us insight into what is a legitimate business to deal with and whatnot.  In the ever-increasing complex world we live in this is becoming more and more important, we cannot rely anymore on being protected by central organizations like governments, police, banks etc.

For 3bot this works in the same way. 3bots are being given capabilities and knowledge by IT experts.  These IT experts can seek digital verifications with known Internet verifiers.  I well used mechanism for central organizations to understand who they accept as customers is Know Your Customer [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer).  This same mechanism can be used in the 3bot world for IT experts, knowledge providers, to be verified for customers: Know Your IT Exper.  

So it is reputation based where the 3bot will have a reputation based on its past, based on its behaviors an based on all the interactions with other 3bots.  All this information is stored in decentralized databases (called blockchain databases, BCDB's, invented by TF Technology) which have the characteristics of a regular blockchain  (always append and immutable data) but can be used like a regular database.  This results in reputation being stored and available for everyone to inspect.

The technical part of the answer to this question is that the technology has a built-in consensus mechanism (item 4 in the image) where end-users, consumers of services, can launch a service if consensus is reached amongst a group of end-users (which can be people or legal entities represented on this grid by respective 3bots).  Respected people or legal entities will offer verifications services which IT experts can build into their services.  This is a build-in decentralized consensus mechanism.
