# Is there a simple way to explain the 30% capacity rule for farming income?

## Question

Do developers and others who wish to use capacity need to contract with each farm individually (including individual household nodes), or is there (or will there be) a means to automatically contract with appropriate nodes (at a default price)? This would be especially important for mobile apps needing capacity to follow the user. 

## Answer
It's 100% automatic.
The user (group of person) has it's own 3bot (your digital avatar). This 3bot builds it's own directory of farmers and knows which farmer is where and capacity and location and quality levels, reputation (phase2), price...
You ask your 3bot for capacity, how much, region, max price level, â€¦ which will match and or automatically make the selection or ask for approval. The 3bot has integrated wallet and pays automatically for the reserved capacity. The 3bot is also your virtual sysadmin which will deploy the workloads you select on the reserved capacity. In phase one reservations are at least 1 month. Later we will support ad hoc reservations (hourly).
