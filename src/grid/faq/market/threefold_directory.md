# How to search for capacity?

## Question

How would an application that is intended for a mobile device negotiate prices with the various ThreeFold farmers as it roams around? This situation especially would require some automatic system-wide pricing. It will be nearly impossible for a provider to negotiate individually with thousands (or eventually millions) of individual farmers.

## Answer

The TreeFold Grid will have a directory, the ThreeFold Directory, that allows current and future user to search capacity based on search criteria. The search criteria still have to be defined but will include things like:

 - Cloud unit pricing
 - Capacity geo-location
 - Service level guaranteed and achieved
 - Some form of feedback on the performance of the farmers capacity used by others
