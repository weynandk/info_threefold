# Hewlett Packard Enterprise

TF Tech and HP Enterprise are partnering to create a strategic plan to help Enterprise around the world to create and deliver private blockchain and compute and storage solutions.

## HPE Overview

HPE is in the Acceleration Business
We help customers use technology to slash the time it takes to turn ideas into value. In turn, they transform industries, markets and lives.

Some of our customers run traditional IT environments. Most are transitioning to a secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-friendly infrastructure. Many rely on a combination of both. Wherever they are in that journey, we provide the technology and solutions to help them succeed.
 

### Technology That Fuels Transformation
We make IT environments more efficient, productive and secure, enabling fast, flexible responses to a rapidly changing competitive landscape. We enable organisations to act quickly on ideas by delivering infrastructure that can be easily composed and recomposed to meet shifting demands so they can lead in today’s marketplace of disruptive innovation.

### Solutions You Need to Succeed
We deliver high-quality, high-value products, consulting and support services in a single package. That’s one of our principal differentiators. We have industry-leading positions in servers, storage, wired and wireless networking, converged systems, software, services and cloud. And with customised financing solutions and strategy, we can provide the right tech solutions for your unique business goals.
Innovating for Today and Tomorrow
Hewlett Packard has been in the innovation business for more than 75 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of an innovation roadmap designed to help organisations of all sizes – from global enterprises to local startups – transition from traditional technology platforms to the IT systems of the future.
We are working to establish Hewlett Packard Enterprise as the main hardware choice for farmers. In addition HPE wants to offer services for their customers and partners around application development and customization using the TF Grid.  Integration of ThreeFold in their multi cloud portal called HPE OneSphere is the ultimate goal for both parties.
