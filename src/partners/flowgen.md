# About the company

FlowGen is a dynamic company developing, producing and selling revolutionary small wind turbines. FlowGen is based in Zug ZG, Switzerland.

Instead of relying on conventional designs, we have designed our wind turbines from first principles, using the most advanced analytical tools available. In this way we have achieved performance levels previously thought impossible.

These performance levels allow us to create a new segment in the wind energy market.

Our Story
Founded by former Porsche GT3 race team leader Dirk Küster in 2010, FlowGen pushes the limits of optimisation in wind energy generation. Under the lead of Dirk, a team of experts from the motorsport aerodynamic area and the automotive industry have created a highly-efficient wind turbine by combining motorsport design tools and advanced aerodynamic know how. Formula 1 analysis tools and experience have been applied throughout the design and development process.

After the design milestones were achieved an automotive production process was conceived and developed with selected, internationally-renowned partners. The result is, a high volume, low cost mass production process which meets the needs of the market and allows us to offer a wind turbine that is practical to use and commercially attractive. To protect its unique concept, FlowGen holds a comprehensive portfolio of international patents as well as design and trademark rights relating the turbine and its parts.

But there are some things you can’t protect with patents. So, we maintain them:
- Our excellent and motivated team
- A solid network
- Room for fresh visions
