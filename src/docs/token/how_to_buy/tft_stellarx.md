# Buying tokens on StellarX (Available April 29)

StellarX is a free peer-to-peer marketplace (decentralized exchange) available on the Stellar Network. It offers trading for a range of assets, using stellar lumens (XLM) as the base currency.

## How does this work?
You can buy TFT only through Stellar Lumens (XLM), for now.

- We have set up a trading bot on StellarX which sells TFT against XLM.
- The price defined at the start is expressed in XLM but represents a value of 0.15 USD during the first month of the TLE. 
- This will allow people to buy real TFT on Stellar with their own wallets.
- On the stellar exchange, people can buy TFT using different cryptoassets, the exchange mechanism allows to find a match with TFT, even if the trading pair is different than TFT/XLM. To do that, it combines trades between different pairs, up to 6 levels. 
- Stellar TFT are provided by the Threefold Foundation, who can be recognized by the mentioned issuer code. 

## Can I start trading with my TFChain TFTs ? 

TFT as available on TFchain will be converted into Stellar TFTA, burned on TFChain with the conversion to the equivalent amount of TFTAs on Stellar. These TFTA can then be converted 1:1 into Stellar TFT, but only progressively and under price conditions, to allow a smooth transition and avoid heavy price fluctuations. The conversion mechanism between TFTA and TFT is available as from June 2020 until end of 2020 in the 3Bot connect app. 

## How do I get started?
1. First, you'll need to get yourself one of the Stellar-compatible wallets listed [here](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets).

2. Next, you will need to trust TFT, which will be issued. Everything is credit on Stellar.

As an example, we have included how to get set up on two Stellar wallets:
- [Lobstr: Desktop & App](tft_lobstr.md)
- [Interstellar: PC-Based](tft_interstellar.md)
