## Structure

![image alt text](../img/structure.png)

Kosmos is our scripting environment (see jumpscale) which allows you to deploy any workload in a very efficient easy manner. The Kosmos shell is very easy to use and can be installed on any platform.

Kosmos and the Kosmos Actors will create a low-level "workload definition" which gets registered on the blockchain database. After verification by humans and or machines (multi-signature on the BCDB) the Zero-OS will pick up the workload and do the local provisioning.
