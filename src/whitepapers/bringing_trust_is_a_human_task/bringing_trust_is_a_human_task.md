# Bringing trust is a human task, not a blockchain one


## Blockchain is just a tool (but a pretty powerful one)

# A little history on blockchain technology 

 

Everyone thinks that Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology when he published his whitepaper in January 2009 which would make a digital currency the first use case. But it was not!.

In 1991, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr W. Scott Stornetta</span> published a white paper in which he introduced the idea of a ‘blockchain’ as a decentralised, database where digital transactions are secured. The cryptographers’ research focused on creating a <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">digital hierarchy system which time-stamped and chronologically secured transactions</span> in a chain of blocks.  The first considered use case for blockchain technology was to digitally sign and store land deeds (see whitepaper). The distinguishing characteristics of this new proposed technology were decentralisation and immutability of stored transaction data.

 

Satoshi was the person or group of persons that used these blockchain principles to create a digital currency.  The rest of the story is known - out of one many digital currencies based on different creation principles (also referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital coins etc.) have been launched and existed  for over a decade and have completed their first hype cycle.

 


# Decentralisation and immutability
 

The two characteristics that have spawned interest in blockchain technology are decentralisation and immutability.  In the current world centralisation is everywhere, in most industries, governments, education systems and more and more also in the world wide web (internet) as we know it.  All roads these days seem to lead to centralised setups.

Examples of centralised setups today:



*   **Monetary**: Fiat currencies are governed and controlled by central banks.  According to wikipedia: “A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state's currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state, and also prints the national currency, which serves as the state's legal tender. Central banks also act as a "lender of last resort" to the banking sector during times of financial crisis. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.”.   \
 \
So central banks control fiat currencies and very little other institutions control central banks. 
*   **World Wide Web (WWW)**: The world wide web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Although distributed and _not_ centralised by design this technology shares and exposes information globally developed centralised functions that are crucial today to make this world wide web work: large (commercial) monopolies have developed centralised search facilities eg. yellow pages of the world wide web.  These search facilities now control what you find when you are looking for a specific search term.

So there seems to be a natural “desire” to organise and create different things with central control.  This might come from us human beings having develop social models that are based on leadership and hierarchies.  These social models have influenced a lot of what we have build in the industrial and information revolution - creating centralisation as the defacto standard of building anything. 

Now that we have invented a technology that potentially can build different things without a lot of centralisation we need to be careful to use it for the right things. 


# Blockchain myths 

Source: this <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">article</span>

In order to investigate what potential right use cases exist for blockchain technologies let spend some time on some of the blockchain myths that have been created in recent years.  As with any new technology blockchains have been named as a miracle technology that that overcome many (if not any) of the challenges and difficulties that exist in modern day digital technology. Let’s name and investigate a few.


## Blockchains are “Super Scalable” 

Is it? Pure blockchain deployments are not super scalable compared to conventional (server-based) transaction methods.  Current financial blockchain transaction times are very slow compared to any other (currency) transaction technologies out there, being it card transactions like Mastercard, VISA, or money transfers from one bank account to another.


## Blockchain technology bring “Impeccable security” 

Very questionable... While blockchain is based on cryptographic standards, the methods to ensure privacy are entirely outside of any blockchain standards and implementations. It's every implementer's responsibility to ensure security. This means that security is largely handled as it is in the old (conventional?) world.


## When using blockchains “Trustworthiness is guaranteed” 

By what? Blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and information storage,  but  otherwise nothing really is inherently trustworthy about any fact stored on the blockchain. You need to corroborate trustworthiness by ensuring that the parties who store facts in the blockchain are incorruptible and that these facts are true —just as you would in the rest of the world without using blockchain technology.


## Blockchains can manage “Anything” 

Blockchain is a protocol expressed in code and this is not defined in terms of any standard. There are no standards bodies to provide sanctioned implementation rules or guidance.

Many contracts or types of data are better dealt with not on a blockchain: as it is a database that has only write and read functionality, but no update nor deletion is possible, it’s even dangerous to post sensitive and personal data on a blockchain, and if not used well, there might raise conflicts with regulations such as GDPR. However, a blockchain could be used to provide consensus where required.


## Smart contracts on the blockchain can do “Everything” 

Potentially but maybe not in the way how people see today. While this is technically true, in practice, blockchain is limited to simple and well-understood use cases, without ambiguities. Smart contracts are essentially rocket science. By design, once published (launched), you cannot revise or bug fix them.


## Blockchain deployments “If not public - go private!” 

Not the same thing…… Private blockchains are not the answer to privacy or restricted access to information. Purely private/enterprise blockchains might fail to realise any of the benefits of blockchain.


## A new feature “justifies deploying a new blockchain” 

Community-driven blockchain products are being forked left and right by private players who enhance them in various ways. But only the open source blockchains with the largest communities and install-plus-adoption bases will persist. The rest can be considered lab experiments and 99.9 percent of these will die horrible deaths.


## Blockchain myths undone 

So blockchains are a great new technology but they are not the answer to everything.  Just like with any other technology or tool you need to carefully consider if the use case considered is appropriate. In the end, it is just neutral characteristics that might be a reason for applying a blockchain or not:



*   is there a need for decentralisation?
*   is there a need for immutability ?

Blockchain technology for a specific purpose needs to be carefully considered and if found appropriate then to be implemented. Humans play a key role in this decision process and are even needed to find a solution for all the flaws blockchains brings along

 

Scalability, security, trustworthiness, functionality are to be added by humans to blockchain deployments. Decentralisation and immutability can be done by blockchain technology alone.

 

This delicate mix of ingredients to be brought together are very likely the reason why many projects in the blockchain space don’t fly, even though there is a rightful claim about the disruptive nature of the technology.

Two frequent mistakes are made:



*   Either the technology is used as the ultimate goal to solve all the problems such as described above, and that will lead to failure in the end, because blockchain can’t fulfil these promises
*   Or the technology is used under the false pretext that decentralisation is wanted, whereas the true intention is to be in control. Blockchain thinking requires also a completely different way of thinking compared to the classical thinking embedded in the heart of our economy: concentration of power & control and competition need to make room for decentralisation and collaboration.


# Blockchains are here to stay!

With all the hype around blockchain technology and also all the failed initiatives, blockchain technology does allow for digital worlds to exist without centralisation.  The information revolution has brought forward a lot of progress and innovation to the people however the outcome has also been only a few large organisations controlling all of it.

 

Examples are:



* Online search: Google
* Online social: Facebook, Tinder
* Online banking: any large international bank
* Online insurance:  few insurance alliances
* Customer Relationship management: SalesForce
* Enterprise Resource Management: Oracle, SAP
All these organisations are leading in their specific sector of digital innovation and some of them even provide services for free.  Nothing is for free in this world and in reality -in return for these services  you accept the terms and conditions which allow the companies to use your personal information and user statistics for their own benefits and make money from this behavior derived data.  

 

Most industry leaders have become so powerful that there is almost no way around them anymore and you are almost obliged to comply with their terms and conditions to do something useful with the internet today.

 

The world is awaking and is seeking alternatives in which data and information are not centrally controlled as in such monopolistic structures.  Blockchain technologies allow new solutions to be built without central governing bodies, creating person to person sharing and trading opportunities.


# The combination of people and blockchains is really powerful 

People are best placed to create decentralised business models combining the strengths of blockchain with complementary measures to compensate for the weaknesses of the technology. Blockchains are not replacing people. Blockchain technology is just a tool, enhancing people's ability to organise themselves around decentralised initiatives that require no central body to govern or control. A powerful tool, but a tool.


## A platform for people to start blockchains 

What if there would be a platform where the strong points of blockchains (decentralisation) can be used as a given to enable people to organise themselves around a random initiative and launch it based on blockchain technology?  Blockchain As a Service (BAAS).

 

A platform like that could be really powerful to enable people around the world to use and benefit from blockchain technology to organise themselves around digital initiatives, currencies, finance, trade, company, anything. Let’s consider a small example:

60 people want to start an organisation in which they all have an equal stake.  They can organise this by going to the notary and establishing  a company that has equity and divide the equity amongst them. They can then run quarterly /annual meetings to govern and control the company. For this to work they need to have some form of administration to record all the decisions and communicate this to the rest of the organisation.

 

What if there is a platform on which they can launch a number of blockchain nodes (60, one for each of them)  in which all decisions are recorded, where all is trackable and traceable for anyone? Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) will enable people to organise themselves independently, create new movements, companies, groups, tribes - anything. This would be a really powerful platform allowing many people (and hopefully all people) to organise themselves in new ways free of the need to have notaries, lawyers and contracts.

However is order to build such a platform it needs to comply with some pretty specific requirements.  Requirements that enable such a platform not to be governed and controlled by a single organisation.  The requirements for such a platform would sum up as follows:



*   The platform cannot be owned by a single organisation, it needs to be owned by many
*   Such a platform cannot have administrator access.  Administrators access takes away the neutrality and privacy that such a platform requires.
*   The platform needs to be very efficient.  If such a platform is to be made available to all people globally it needs to be affordable by anyone
*   The platform needs to be everywhere.  Part of the efficiency is that it should to require expensive international access lines - it needs to be able to live everywhere - in well connected (and affordable) areas as well as in less well connected places.

Such a platform is a very different platform than most of what we know today.  It needs to be a platform build by many people, for anyone.  It needs to not be governed by a single organisation, it needs to be governed by many.

People with the right intentions need to be invited to get together and build such a platform based on hardware owned by many and software that is open and can be inspected and improved by anyone. In the end it is a platform build by people for people using blockchain technology to achieve a true decentralised nature of the platform running blockchain as a service.  

IT is People that provide trust, not blockchains. But blockchains help to register that trust forever.
