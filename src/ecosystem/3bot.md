# 3Bot

This project is one of the major use cases on the TF Grid.

3Bot is a revolutionary digital avatar that is designed to execute all of your digital needs. A definitive leap to true digital privacy, where only you can access your data, and no one else â€“ not even us.

With 3Bot, free yourself from an app-centric system and enter a more secure, neutral, and decentralised digital world designed with you in the center. There will soon be no need for many applications on your device anymore.

3Bots manage and enable both the ThreeFold and FreeFlow Ecosystems. 

To function properly and remain active on the TF Grid each 3Bot requires ThreeFold Grid capacity and thus ThreeFold Tokens.
