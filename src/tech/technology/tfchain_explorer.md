The Explorer for the testnet is currently available on: https://explorer.testnet.threefoldtoken.com and for the production net on https://explorer.threefoldtoken.com

You can install your own instance of the Explorer on Linux, Mac or Windows.

Below we discuss the steps to install the Explorer on Linux:

> We highly recommend against installing the Explorer on the same host as your wallet.

## Get the ThreeFold Chain binaries

In order to run your own Explorer, you first need to have a ThreeFold Chain node running on the same host, which requires the ThreeFold Chain daemon (`tfchaind`).

See [Getting the ThreeFold Chain Binaries](get_binaries.md) for instructions on how to get the ThreeFold daemon.


## Start the ThreeFold Chain daemon

Start the ThreeFold Chain daemon in the background:
```bash
tfchain_dir="/tfchain"
cd $tfchain_dir/release/tfchain-v0.6.1-linux-amd64/cmd
./tfchaind -M cgte &
<ENTER>
```

## Install Caddy

From the command line:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get install curl
curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal
```

## Get the Explorer

The explorer is available from the [threefoldfoundation/tfchain](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain) GitHub repository.

Clone the repository:
```bash
apt-get install git
mkdir -p /opt/code/github/threefoldfoundation

cd /opt/code/github/threefoldfoundation
git clone https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain.git
```

## Start Caddy

From the command line:
```bash
cd /opt/code/github/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/frontend/explorer
caddy -conf Caddyfile.local &
```

As result the Caddy server will be available on port 2015:

http://<localhost>:2015/
