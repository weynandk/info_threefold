## Cloud Units

![](./img/domore.png)

Cloud units are the way to account for farmed and used capacity. Cloud units are the compute, storage and network equivalent to kWh - kilowatt-hour - the unit of energy.

We utilize three categories of units:

- Compute: the amount of data processing power, specified as the number of virtual CPU cores (logical [CPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)) and RAM ([Random Access Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory))
- Storage: the size of data storage capacity with a certain access speed ([IOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS))
- Network: the amount of data that travels in and out of the acquired storage units or data that travels to/from compute capacity.
