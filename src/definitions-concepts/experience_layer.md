## Experience Layer

This layer is where the human imagination and experience come into play. It is where users can access different sets of experiences (communication & messaging, file manager, browser, website builder, wiki, collaboration tools, decentralized digital wallet, and more) and where creators can build new experiences. The possibilities are endless. This is the layer that best represents the current user experience with today’s Internet – the applications and services we use regularly, but now with humans at the center and in control.
 
Any web technology can be used to create the most amazing applications. The advanced architecture of ThreeFold saves 90% of development efforts to develop new applications or convert existing solutions. All applications employ secured login through 3Bot Connect to fulfill the highest standards in security and privacy.
