## ThreeFold Values

ThreeFold has three main values or pillars :

**Equality** | The Internet should be inclusive to all of humanity. We are building an Internet that is owned by many, can be deployed everywhere, and is accessible to all. Everyone should enjoy a fair return for their provided value. There is no reason for middlemen in a peer-to-peer economy.

**Freedom** | The Internet should be responsible and democratized, respectful of individual privacy, neutral, and secure, and provide freedom to  all stakeholders. Everyone should own their own data just like they own their experiences in reality.

**Sustainability** | We need an Internet that is environmentally conscious, where networks, hardware and software components, as well as processes are optimized around energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality as much as possible.
