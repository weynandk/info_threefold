## Autonomous Layer

You can think about this layer as similar to a bee hive, where worker bees create complex “magic” by performing quite simple yet necessary tasks altogether.

Imagine the autonomous layer as being the bridge between users and the capacity layer. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure and services, and vastly minimizing the possibility of hacking. This represents a major breakthrough in IT.

The autonomous layer is where 3Bots live and interact with each other. With 3Bot, free yourself from an app-centric system and enter a more secure, neutral, and decentralized digital world designed with you in the center. Your digital identity and data is fully protected as 3Bot is stateless and decentralized by design.  3Bot is still in development and the vision is to undertake 80% of your current digital workloads.

Some key characteristics include:

- Fair: All access to data and information can be revoked at any time. That means 3Bot users retain full ownership of their data.
- Efficient: The unique architecture makes accessing the data much more efficient than today - saving 90% energy and bandwidth.
- Autonomous: Deploys and operates the infrastructure without human interaction. 
- Resilient: The self-healing operating system ensures that in the unlikely case that a node goes down, your data remains private and available.
- Trustless: No controlling centralized institution. In 3Bots peer-to-peer architecture, everyone is equal.
- Secure: 2FA login, peer-reviews, KYC integration, a decentralized ledger and lean coding ensure highest security standards.
- Compatible: 3Bot technology mimics the protocols of older, centralized servers for e-mail (IMAP, SMTP, POP3), contacts (Caldav), and files  (Webdav, FTP). That way it can blend in with existing smartphones and access existing applications while still providing all of its features.
- Complete: 3Bot removes the need to store digital information like calendar entries or photos in several locations. It is the best place to store your complete digital life.
- Developer friendly: Developing applications for 3Bot it easy and quick. Decluttered architecture together with our system development kit save 90% of development effort compared to conventional centralized applications.
- Open source: We believe in sharing information and are inviting the world to build on our work.

3Bot is currently in Beta version. Follow our announcements regarding the upcoming implementations at https://forum.threefold.io/ or https://t.me/threefoldnetwork.

You can already reserve your 3Bot name through 3Bot Connect that is already available on Android and iOS. 3Bot connect is the gateway to 3Bot and provides private and secure logins to all of its components.
