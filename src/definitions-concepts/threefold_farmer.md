## ThreeFold Farmer

TF Farmers are entrepreneurs who farm ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold Grid.

As a result of Farming, Internet capacity is generated and available on the ThreeFold Grid Directory.

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:
- Farming: as a result of connecting server/storage hardware to the ThreeFold Grid

- Cultivation: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised (sold) by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users

There are two types of capacity farmers:

- Certified Farmers: A certified hardware using farmer that has entered into, and is compliant with, the present Terms of the TF Tech Service Level Agreement.

- DIY Farmers: Use their own choice of hardware (uncertified hardware)
