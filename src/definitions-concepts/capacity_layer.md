## Capacity Layer

Much in the way the trees and plants in a forest communicate and share nutrients through underground channels, the capacity layer includes an expanding grid of intelligent connection for the ThreeFold Network.

Think of the capacity layer as being the foundation of the Internet. It consists of hardware and software components that together form the physical infrastructure needed to make all experiences possible. Without storage and computing capacity, there would be no Internet.

The ThreeFold Grid is the most advanced decentralized network of compute and storage on the planet. It is a more performant and sustainable alternative to centralized cloud providers with about 40PB deployed in 21+ countries. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost. Any individual or organization can already utilize ThreeFold Grid capacity for any current or future IT workload.

Some key characteristics include:

- Decentralized: Consists of 3Nodes - affordable, secure and highly efficient cloud storage units that can be purchased and hosted by anyone for about 1000 USD.
- Efficient:  Algorithms ensure the data is hosted where it is needed.
- Secure: A storage algorithm inspired by space-technology is used and ensures the integrity of all data, even if some nodes go offline.
- Sustainable: Being decentralized and using the greenest hardware available, the ThreeFold Grid is able to save 90% energy compared to conventional data centers. 
- Tamperproof: Algorithms prove that workloads on the ThreeFold Grid are executed as intended.
- Affordable: Data hosted on the ThreeFold Grid costs 70% less compared to other cloud providers.
- Fair: People that run 3Nodes are called farmers. They are remunerated and incentivized to constantly expand the ThreeFold Grid by generating ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) for the capacity provided.
- Open source: All the technology is available on GitHub. Join us and letâ€™s build a better digital world together.
