# Threefold Tokenomics In 4 Easy Steps

Step 1a. Farmer adds capacity to the grid

Step 1b. Grid rewards farmer with TFT

Step 2a. Farmer trades his TFT on an exchange

Step 2b. Farmer gets other currencies in return.

Step 3a. User sells currencies on an exchange

Step 3b. User gets TFT in return.

Step 4a. Grid provides Capacity to the user

Step 4b. User pays the farmer for capacity with TFT. Part of the transaction goes to the foundation, a part gets burned.

# Earning Tokens

The ThreeFold Token is developed in a way that it incentivizes the growth of the ThreeFold Grid. 

Each farmer has two streams of TFT income:

# Farming

**PROOF-OF-CAPACITY**

When a person puts capacity on the ThreeFold Grid, this process is called Farming. To incentivize farming, the farmer will be remunerated a certain amount of tokens for doing so. 

The number of tokens the farmer earns is dependent on multiple factors:

** Server/Node Specs of the Farmers Hardware**

* Compute Capacity (CPU)

* Memory Capacity (RAM)

* Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

These factors combine to a Cloud Production Rate (CPR). The higher the CPR, the more tokens are earned.

**Grid Specs (This is the same for all farmers at every point in time)**

* Farming Difficulty (the actual difficulty factor determining how fast TFT’s are created through farming)


# Cultivation

Anyone can run applications and workloads on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Capacity can be reserved from the Farmer who has made this capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid. This payment for capacity will be made in ThreeFold Tokens. Cultivation incentivizes farmers to create capacity where it is needed most by rewarding them when that capacity is used.

# Support Of The Threefold Foundation 

In order to promote the growth and development of the ThreeFold Grid, a percentage of all cultivation transactions goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.

This percentage equals 10% at the moment. After 24 months of farming, it will go down to 5%.

# Maximum Of Tokens In Circulation

### To maximize the value of the ThreeFold Token (TFT) for all token holders, there is a 2 billion cap on the maximum amount of ThreeFold Token in circulation at all times. To make sure this TFT cap is adhered, the following mechanisms have been introduced:

## Burning

40-45% of the tokens for each Cultivation transaction will be burned. That means only the transactions where capacity users pay farmers for that capacity. Transactions that are made to other wallets, exchanges, etc are not subject to the burning of tokens.

E.g. a farmer asks 100 TFT for a certain amount of capacity + timeframe. The user of this capacity will pay the full 100 TFT. The farmer receives 50% of this amount, as 40-45% is burned off, and 10-5% of the transaction also goes to the ThreeFold Foundation.

## Difficulty level

As mentioned in the farming section of this wiki entry, the amount of farmed tokens a Farmer receives when putting capacity online is subject to the difficulty level. This difficulty level is there to ensure there won’t be an oversupply of tokens nor capacity. The more ThreeFold Tokens exist, the fewer Tokens are distributed through Farming. The burning mechanism ensures the difficulty level does not stay at a level where it's not profitable to farm. 

# An Inclusive Market	

The market for farming, cultivating and trading is open to all. If one has an internet connection and a power outlet he/she can become a Farmer, cultivate capacity and trade ThreeFold Tokens (TFT). Third party exchanges ensure that TFT can be exchanged between farmers and capacity users. 

# The Valuation Of The Grid

Each ThreeFold Token is tied to underlying capacity. The valuation of the total capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, gives an indication of the value of all ThreeFold Tokens in circulation. 

To evaluate the storage and compute capacity of the ThreeFold Grid, we use very low pricing compared to other cloud offerings in the current market.

**Compute Unit (CU): 4 GB memory & 2 virtual CPU **

    *  TF Simulation price = 8 USD

    *  Market price = between 40 USD and 120 USD

**Storage Unit (SU): 1TB of netto usable storage**

* TF Simulation price = 5 USD

* Market price = between 20 USD and 120 USD
