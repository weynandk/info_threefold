# What can be the impact of government regulation on cryptocurrencies?

## Answer

Governments lag behind technology innovation, but is it fair to assume that they will step in to regulate crypto currencies or potentially even decide to do their own? What if the US Government introduces a digital dollar, what might be the likely impact will be on ThreeFold tokens? If that happened why would anyone need tokens if they can simply trade in a digital version of their own fiat currency? Would national digital dollar be a good candidate for a managed ThreeFold system? Could ThreeFold token exchanges be taxed, for example, to provide funds for public services?

The ThreeFold token is has the following characteristics:
 - it is backed by the the gold of the digital age:  internet processing and storage Capacity
 - it is green token - no dirty mining as the TF Chain runs proof of stake blockchain technology
 - supply and issuance of the token and is controlled by algorithm and tied to the amount of capacity available on the grid and cannot be manipulated by any party
