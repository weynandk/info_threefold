# How are ThreeFold Tokens valued relative to farming capacity?

## Question

If the token value relative to fiat currency “floats” on the open speculative market, then its value can change rapidly by large amounts. The value of capacity in terms of fiat currency will fluctuate correspondingly unless the cost of internet capacity in tokens is also allowed to float. If not, then if the speculative market for tokens drives the price up, the ThreeFold internet capacity could rapidly become more expensive than that of the current cloud providers. Will internet capacity in tokens be allowed to float?

## Answer

The mechanism here is as follows:
 - Token value is determined by demand and supply on token markets, where supply maps one to one to the internet capacity made available by the farmers, and demand maps to the need for Grid capacity.
 - ThreeFold Grid capacity pricing is set by farmers in **fiat** currency.

 Therefore the farmer can set his capacity pricing against the global market / competitors. This is done in the (local) fiat currency. When reserving Grid capacity, the total pricing for reserved capacity will be calculated (week, month, quarter of annual) and translated against the current token value. The amount of tokens required to reserve the same capacity might vary based on the token value. A higher token value provides you more ThreeFold capacity purchase power. A lower price result in lesser.
