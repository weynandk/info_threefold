Seed Phrase allows you to access and recover your wallet from any device. 
We highly recommend write down your seed key on a paper and store it safely offline.

> **3Bot does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Losing your private key means losing access to your wallet and all your ThreeFold Tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your 3Bot Connect wallet and ThreeFold tokens**

> **To access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed), without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.**
