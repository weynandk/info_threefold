## Enable two-factor authentication

> It is not recommended to keep your funds permanently on a public exchange or use a public exchange as a wallet, because exchanges are more likely to be hacked than your personal wallet.

It is highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your BTC-Alpha account.

To do that, first install **Authy** or **Google Authenticator** on your mobile phone:
    - https://authy.com/download/
    - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en
    - https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8

Then configure 2FA by going through the process on **TWO FACTOR AUTH** page:
