4. Within a few minutes, you will receive an email confirming your account and an email regarding one last verification. It looks like Liquid is testing the sign-up process. It seems that some people will be asked to verify on the website, while others will be given the option to verify via video call. Follow the instructions in the email you receive. Although, see our note below to complete your verification.

*Note: If you’re not given the option to verify via video but would like to do so, follow the instructions [here](https://help.liquid.com/en/articles/3104816-video-call-kyc-verification).

If anything is still unclear here, please contact an admin on the [ThreeFold Network News](https://t.me/threefoldnetwork) Telegram Channel.

Please note there is a mobile application called “liquid” which might be easier to do you verification. It will  use your phone camera to “capture” your selfie, passport and proof of residency information.

**Again, please note you are not fully registered until you verify your account.**
