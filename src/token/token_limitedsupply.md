# Limited Supply of TFT
While the ThreeFold Grid can expand infinitely as long as there is demand for capacity, a maximum of 4 Billion TFTs can be in circulation. This limit ensures stability of value and incentivization for all stakeholders.

### Why is a limited supply beneficial for everyone?
Like every item, service or currency, TFT derives a part of its value from scarcity. Thus the scarcity adds value to TFT, which lets all TFT holders benefit. They are ensured that their asset can´t be reduced in value by inflation.

### Farmer Incentivization
Let us first understand that [Farmers](farmer_progam.md) are incentivized by receiving TFT in two ways. 
1. When [farming](farmer_progam.md), by adding new capacity to the ThreeFold Grid through connected hardware
2. Developers and users pay farmers in TFT to rent their capacity

### Difficulty level
The amount of TFT that Farmers receive for farming depends on the amount of TFT that are already in circulation. The more TFT already exist, the lower the rewards. This follows the principle of diminishing returns. We call this farming limitation to rewards **Difficulty Level**.

When the amount of existing TFT nears 4 billion, the amount of TFT received by farmers will be less. Once the maximum of 4 billion TFT has been reached, there won´t be any rewards for farming anymore.

Our [simulations](https://sdk3.threefold.io/#/simulator_install) shows that there is still the possibility to add about 2 million 3Nodes to the TF Grid while earning farming rewards in TFT.

After this point in time, farmers will solely earn TFT by cultivation. Considering the features and the effectiveness of the architecture of the ThreeFold Grid, our simulations show that it will still be profitable after that point.

***Important note: TFT’s are not an investment instrument.***
