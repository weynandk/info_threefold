# What are ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)?

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold Network. 

The ThreeFold Token represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity on the TF Grid. Capacity is a new high-demand market, and TFT will be the medium of exchange for this commodity. TFT synergistically connects the world of cloud and blockchain markets to the most scalable universal substrate without compromising, performance, security and privacy.

# ThreeFold Token 101

## Farming TFT's

ThreeFold Tokens are generated through a process called "Farming". Farming happens when active internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Independent farmers earn ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by providing neutral and decentralized internet capacity, thus expending the usable Grid. Therefore no central entity controls the internet.

## TFT Features

### Decentralized, Neutral & Secure
ThreeFold Tokens are driven by autonomous and decentralized infrastructure making them neutral, energy efficient and secure.


### Utility Driven
ThreeFold Capacity can be used for anything, for instance for storage or computing power, which can be used for any IT workload.


### Sound Economy
Tokens are only generated when capacity is added. ThreeFold Tokens are generated only when new IT capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

### Planet Friendly
No mining, Tokens are generated by adding active internet capacity to the ThreeFold Network. TFT nodes are driven by an open-source operating system which produces energy efficient Internet capacity.


### Secure Consensus
TFT's are powered by Rivine, ThreeFold's native blockchain, which is a Proof of Blockstake protocol, using staked nodes to vote on the network.


### Autonomous Transactions 
TFt's are powered by autonomous agent centric bots called "3Bots" which insures the neutrality, scalability and security of transactions on the ThreeFold Network. 

### Lows Fees
Very low network fee's at only 0,01 TFT.
