# Now: Buy TFT through StellarX

If you would like to start playing with the TF Grid today, you will need to purchase ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) through StellarX, Stellar's decentralized (peer-to-peer) exchange.

## How does this work?
You can buy TFT only through Stellar Lumens (XLM), for now.

- We have set up a trading bot on StellarX which will sell real Stellar TFTs
- This will allow people to buy real TFT on the Stellar Network with their own wallets
- TFT will be provided by [entity]. We will burn all TFT that are converted from the TF Chain to Stellar


## How do I get started?
1. First, you'll need to get yourself one of the Stellar-compatible wallets listed [here](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets).

2. Next, you will need to trust TFT, which will be issued. Everyting is credit on Stellar.

    _The Bot will connect to the Kracken exchange to find the price of XLM and will modify sell orders to match 0.15 USD (the price of the TFT)._

_Notes / Extras:_

- _Rob will create an example this weekend. We can try a different wallet. Will first do it on testnet. We should test another wallet as well._
- _Only place lumens against TFT orders._
- _The stellar exchange allows people to buy using differents assets and converts it to Lumens first. 
- _If ppl have BTC and has a buy order / sell order._
- _We will place sell orders through lumens._
- _Will create so always 0.15 USD in Lumens._
